## **_Installation_**
Here are some guidelines for installing the project on your local machine: 

1. Clone or download the repository to your own local machine and run it from your command line.

2. Then, make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running ```npm init``` in your command line.

3. Run ```npm i``` or ```npm install``` in order to download all the dependencies.

4. Store your variables in an .env file. Some of the variables you will need are: ```DB_NAME```, ```DB_PW``` and ```DB_USER``` for your local database credentials, ```DB_EMAIL``` and ```DB_PASS``` for nodemailer/contact-from credentials. And don't forget to include your .env file into your .gitignore to keep your credentials secret.. ðŸ¤«
